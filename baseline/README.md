# Few-shot vid2vid \& Baseline

We run [few-shot-vid2vid](https://github.com/NVlabs/few-shot-vid2vid) following released official code https://github.com/NVlabs/few-shot-vid2vid. Moreover, we build baseline under this framework. Details of the two models will be introduced.

## Few-shot vid2vid

The prerequisities as well as training and testing process are the same as official code of [few-shot vid2vide](https://github.com/NVlabs/few-shot-vid2vid). We modify architecture of code for data loader and modules in order for better generality. But the model is kept as the same as [paper](https://github.com/NVlabs/few-shot-vid2vid).
